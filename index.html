    <p>
        People make a big deal out of cooking food. It seems daunting to actually learn this 
        extremely valuable skill. I'm here to show you it's not that big of a deal. <br />
        We're going to patiently learn that it's not that hard to make good food, and it might actually 
        be even fun.
